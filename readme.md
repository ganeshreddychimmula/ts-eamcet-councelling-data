    * College (Top institutions in Telangana)
    * Branch (CSE, ECE, IT, EEE, MEC, CIV, and specializations like AI&ML, Data Science)
    * Year (2022, 2023, 2024)
    * Category (OC Male/Female, EWS Male/Female, General, etc.)
* **College Ranking List:** Displays a list of top engineering colleges based on EAPCET performance.
* **Multi-Year Data:** Includes cutoff information from 2022, 2023 (Final Phase where available), and 2024 (primarily Round 1 OC General).
* **Category-Specific Cutoffs:** Provides detailed cutoffs for different reservation categories, including male/female distinctions.
* **Responsive Design:** Accessible on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **Organized Code Structure:** (Conceptual) JavaScript organized into modules for data, DOM manipulation, UI updates, and logic. CSS organized with CUBE CSS principles in mind.

## üìà Data Source & Disclaimer

The data presented in this application has been collated from:
* The "TS Eamcet councelling data" document provided (presumably based on official TSCHE releases and reputable educational portals).
* Information regarding 2022 and 2023 cutoffs from "TS EAMCET 2022 & 2023 Engineering Counselling Data (Telangana)" (likely derived from official last-rank statements).

**Important Disclaimer:**
* The data is for informational and reference purposes only.
* 2024 data is largely based on Round 1 Closing Ranks for OC General. 2022 & 2023 data is collated from multiple sources, prioritizing final phase information where available.
* While efforts have been made to ensure accuracy, this tool may not be exhaustive or reflect the absolute latest official figures for all categories/colleges/branches.
* **Always refer to the official Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) websites (eapcet.tsche.ac.in and tgeapcet.nic.in) for the most definitive and up-to-date information.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **HTML5:** For structuring the web page.
* **CSS3:**
    * **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first styling and responsive design.
    * Custom CSS organized with **CUBE CSS** (Composition, Utility, Block, Exception) principles in mind within the `<style>` tags.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactivity, data manipulation, and DOM updates.
    * Conceptually organized into modules for better structure (Data Store, DOM Elements, UI Module, Filter Logic, Initialization).

## üöÄ How to Use / Run

This is a static web application.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ganeshreddychimmula/ts-eamcet-councelling-data.git](https://github.com/ganeshreddychimmula/ts-eamcet-councelling-data.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ts-eamcet-councelling-data
    ```
3.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    * Simply open the `index.html` (or the main HTML file in the repository) in your preferred web browser.
    * **Note:** If you encounter issues with JavaScript modules (due to CORS policy) when opening directly via `file:///`, it's recommended to serve the files using a local development server. Many simple servers are available (e.g., `Live Server` extension in VS Code, Python's `http.server`, or `npx serve`).

Once loaded, you can use the dropdown filters to select College, Branch, Year, and Category, then click "Apply Filters" to view the relevant cutoff data in the table.

## üìÅ File Structure (Conceptual)

While the application might be delivered as a single `index.html` file with embedded CSS and JavaScript for simplicity in this context, the internal code organization follows these conceptual separations:

* **`index.html`**: Main application file containing HTML structure, CSS styles (within `<style>`), and JavaScript logic (within `<script>`).
* **CSS (within `index.html` `<style>` tags):**
    * **Composition Layer:** Global styles, resets (handled by Tailwind preflight), layout primitives.
    * **Block Layer:** Styles for specific UI components (e.g., `.filter-controls`, `.results-table`).
    * **Utility Layer:** Primarily handled by Tailwind CSS.
* **JavaScript (within `index.html` `<script>` tags):**
    * **`DATA_STORE` module:** Holds all raw cutoff data, college name mappings, and category display names.
    * **`DOM_ELEMENTS` module:** Centralizes references to DOM elements.
    * **`UTILS` module:** General helper functions.
    * **`UI_MODULE`:** Functions for populating dropdowns, displaying results in the table, managing loader visibility.
    * **`FILTER_LOGIC` module:** Handles the filtering of data based on user selections.
    * **`APP_INIT` module:** Initializes the application, sets up filters, and attaches event listeners.
    * *(If you were to separate files, you might have `js/main.js`, `js/data.js`, `js/ui.js`, `js/util/domUtils.js`, etc.)*
